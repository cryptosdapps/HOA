        <h1>Hello Dear Residents,</h1>
        <p>My name is <span class="bold">Behzad Ghofranian</span>. I have been living in the U.S. for almost 50 years—first in California and for the past 14 years in Florida. I have a lot of experience in financial jobs and management.</p>

        <p>To be honest with you, I have a super full-time job and I am not free like some people to sit in the office all day from morning to afternoon for no reason, or walk around room by room, floor by floor, looking for something to do just because I have nothing else going on in my life.</p>

        <p>First of all, we should know what the job of the <span class="bold">Board of Directors (BOD)</span> is and not mix it with property management or maintenance jobs. If we get on the board, it doesn’t mean we have to be in the office or the building 24/7—unless we have no actual job or anything else to do.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, we should keep in mind that being on the board doesn’t mean we captured the building and own it, or that the residents are our hostages and we can do whatever we want with their lives and money.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t interested in being on the board at first, but after seeing what’s going on here, I suddenly decided to run, even though I’m very busy. Maybe some people are against me because they already know exactly what I will do if I get elected.</p>

        <h2>Here’s What I Will Do:</h2>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">REAL TRANSPARENCY</span> – Not just some verbal nonsense. I will send all BOD meeting minutes to the residents.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">No More Hiding Contracts & Documents</span> – I will stop keeping things secret from residents.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">No More Personal Benefits</span> – The board is not a business for personal gain.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">No More Retaliation, Harassment, or Threatening Residents</span> – People should not be scared to ask questions.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">No More Breaking Florida Laws</span> – I will follow legal processes properly.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">No More Treating Residents Like Prisoners</span> – This is our home, not a dictatorship.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">No More Lies</span> – I will inform all residents immediately about everything happening in the building.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>If a resident requests records from us, I won’t ignore them—I will respond properly.</p>
        <p>I don’t need to make money off your money. I won’t cross the red lines against the residents or the law. I will educate myself about the laws before making ridiculous decisions. I will stop being greedy in every way.</p>

        <p>Yes, this is who I am, and that’s why some specific people may not like me. I don’t care who likes me. I just want to save my money and yours. Wasting our money is enough.</p>

        <p>I want to show you what’s going on in this building with <span class="bold">documents</span>—not just words.</p>

        <div class="cta">
            <p>If you agree with what I will do when I get on the board, <span class="bold">vote for me</span> to make sure we go by the law only.</p>
